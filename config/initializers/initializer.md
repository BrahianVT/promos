You're using the fog/aws gem with CarrierWave to handle uploads to Amazon S3. The great news is that fog/aws handles determining the correct S3 endpoint URL for you automatically based on the region you specify in your configuration.

Here's a breakdown:

Region Configuration:

Your code reads the AWS region from your ApplicationConfig hash:
region: ApplicationConfig["AWS_UPLOAD_REGION"].presence || ApplicationConfig["AWS_DEFAULT_REGION"]
This means you should set either AWS_UPLOAD_REGION or AWS_DEFAULT_REGION in your application's configuration to the appropriate AWS region (e.g., "us-east-1", "eu-west-2", etc.).
Fog/AWS Behind the Scenes:

When you upload a file using CarrierWave and fog/aws, the gem internally constructs the correct S3 endpoint URL using the region you provided.
You don't need to manually build the endpoint URL string yourself.

Yes, you can override the S3 endpoint used by CarrierWave and `fog/aws`, although it's not commonly needed.  Here's how you can do it, along with reasons you might need to:

**How to Override the Endpoint**

1. **Directly in `fog_credentials`:**

   ```ruby
   CarrierWave.configure do |config|
     # ... other configurations ...

     config.fog_credentials = {
       provider: "AWS",
       aws_access_key_id: ApplicationConfig["AWS_ID"],
       aws_secret_access_key: ApplicationConfig["AWS_SECRET"],
       region: ApplicationConfig["AWS_UPLOAD_REGION"].presence || ApplicationConfig["AWS_DEFAULT_REGION"],
       endpoint: "https://your-custom-endpoint.com" # Override here 
     }
   end
   ```

2. **Using `fog_attributes`:**

   ```ruby
   CarrierWave.configure do |config|
     # ... other configurations ...

     config.fog_attributes = {
       endpoint: "https://your-custom-endpoint.com"  # Override here 
     }
   end
   ```

**When You Might Need to Override**

* **Connecting to S3-Compatible Services:** You might be using an alternative storage provider that's compatible with the S3 API (e.g., MinIO, Ceph RadosGW, DigitalOcean Spaces). These services often have different endpoints.
* **Specific S3 Endpoint Structure:**  In rare cases, you might need to connect to a non-standard S3 endpoint URL.

**Caution**

* **Testing:** Be very careful when overriding the endpoint, especially in production environments. Ensure the custom endpoint you provide is correct and secure.
* **Region Considerations:** If you override the endpoint, you might also need to manage region-specific settings manually.

**Example: Using MinIO**

```ruby
CarrierWave.configure do |config|
  # ... other configurations ...

  config.fog_credentials = {
    provider: "AWS",
    aws_access_key_id: "your-minio-access-key",
    aws_secret_access_key: "your-minio-secret-key",
    endpoint: "http://your-minio-host:9000" 
  }
end
```

**Recommendation**

- If you're using the standard Amazon S3 service, it's generally best practice to let `fog/aws` handle endpoint resolution automatically. 
- Only override the endpoint if you have a compelling reason.
