# app\models\article.rb

The code you provided defines an `Article` model in a Ruby on Rails application. Let's break down the key components and functionalities:

**Core Functionality**

- **Database Table Representation:** The `Article` class inherits from `ApplicationRecord`, making it an ActiveRecord model that interacts with a database table named "articles."
- **Attributes:** Articles have attributes like `title`, `body_markdown` (Markdown content), `slug` (URL-friendly identifier), `published` (boolean indicating publication status), `published_at` (publication date/time), and many more.
- **Relationships:** Articles have relationships with other models like `User` (author), `Organization` (optional), `Collection` (for series), `Comments`, `Tags`, `Reactions`, and others.
- **Validations:** Various validations ensure data integrity, like requiring a title, limiting body size, enforcing uniqueness of URLs, and checking for valid publication dates.

**Key Features and Behaviors**

1. **Content Management:**
   - **Markdown Processing:** Articles use Markdown for content (`body_markdown`). The `evaluate_markdown` method processes Markdown into HTML (`processed_html`) using a `ContentRenderer`.
   - **Front Matter:** Articles can have YAML front matter for metadata like title, tags, publication status, and more. The `evaluate_front_matter` method handles this data.
   - **Slug Generation:** Automatic slug generation based on the title makes URLs user-friendly (`create_slug`).
   - **Tagging:** Articles are taggable using the `acts_as_taggable_on` gem.
   - **Image Handling:** The code includes features for managing a `main_image` and generating `social_image`.
   - **Video Support:** Articles support embedding videos from URLs. Attributes like `video`, `video_thumbnail_url`, and `video_duration_in_seconds` manage video data.

2. **Publishing and Scheduling:**
   - **Publication Status:** The `published` attribute controls whether an article is visible.
   - **Scheduled Publishing:**  Articles can have a future `published_at` for scheduling.

3. **User Interactions:**
   - **Comments:** Articles have a `comments` association, allowing users to discuss the content.
   - **Reactions:** Users can react to articles (similar to likes) using the `Reactable` concern.
   - **User Mentions:** Articles can mention users, triggering notifications.

4. **Scoring and Ranking:**
   - **Scoring System:** Articles have a `score` based on factors like reactions, comments, and potentially user reputation (`update_score`).
   - **Hotness Score:** A `hotness_score` likely contributes to article visibility and ranking.

5. **Search and Indexing:**
   - **Search Optimization:** Features like `search_optimized` and `seo_boostable` aim to improve search engine visibility.
   - **Full-Text Search:** The code uses PostgreSQL's full-text search (`pg_search_scope`) for searching within articles.

6. **Caching:**
   - **Cache Busting:**  The code employs cache busting mechanisms to ensure content freshness after updates (`bust_cache`).
   - **Data Serialization:**  Some associated data is serialized and cached within the `Article` record itself (e.g., `cached_user`, `cached_organization`) to improve performance.

7. **Background Jobs:**
   - Various tasks are delegated to background jobs using Active Job and workers, such as:
     - Score calculation (`Articles::ScoreCalcWorker`)
     - Cache busting (`Articles::BustCacheWorker`)
     - Social image generation (`Images::SocialImageWorker`)

**Concerns and Modules**

- **CloudinaryHelper:** Likely provides methods for interacting with the Cloudinary image/video hosting service.
- **Reactable:** Handles user reactions (likes, etc.).
- **Taggable:** Provides tagging functionality.
- **UserSubscriptionSourceable:**  Manages user subscriptions related to articles.
- **PgSearch::Model:** Enables PostgreSQL full-text search.
- **AlgoliaSearchable:**  Indicates integration with the Algolia search service.

**Overall, this is a well-structured and feature-rich Article model designed to power a blogging or content-sharing platform.** It leverages various gems, background jobs, and caching techniques to ensure efficient content management, user engagement, and optimal performance. 


### Adding new fields

Here's a breakdown of how to add a "price" field (as a float) to your Rails `Article` model:

**1. Generate a Migration**

   Rails migrations manage changes to your database schema:

   ```bash
   rails generate migration AddPriceToArticles price:float
   ```

   This creates a new migration file (e.g., `db/migrate/[timestamp]_add_price_to_articles.rb`).

**2. Edit the Migration**

   Open the newly created migration file and add the `price` column:

   ```ruby
   class AddPriceToArticles < ActiveRecord::Migration[7.0]
     def change
       add_column :articles, :price, :float
     end
   end
   ```

**3. Run the Migration**

   Apply the changes to your database:

   ```bash
   rails db:migrate
   ```

**4. Update Validations (Optional)**

   Add validations to the `Article` model (`app/models/article.rb`) if needed:

   ```ruby
   class Article < ApplicationRecord
     # ... other code ...

     validates :price, numericality: { greater_than_or_equal_to: 0, allow_blank: true } 
     # Ensures price is non-negative and allows blank values

     # ... other code ...
   end
   ```

**5. Update Forms and Views**

   Modify your article forms (e.g., `_form.html.erb` or equivalent) to include a field for the `price` attribute:

   ```erb
   <%= form.label :price %>
   <%= form.number_field :price, step: 0.01 %> 
   ```

**Additional Considerations:**

- **Data Type:**  A `float` is generally suitable for prices, but for very precise financial calculations, consider using `decimal`.
- **Default Value:** You might want to set a default value in the migration:

   ```ruby
   add_column :articles, :price, :float, default: 0.0
   ```
- **Currency Handling:** If you need to store currency information, consider a dedicated library like `money-rails` to handle formatting, conversions, and potential complexities of different currencies.
- **Testing:** Add tests to cover the new functionality, including validations, form submission, and display in views. 

Let me know if you have any other questions. 



You can generate a random price and directly assign it within the `Article.create!` call:

```ruby
article = Article.create!(
  body_markdown: markdown,
  featured: i.zero?, 
  show_comments: true,
  user_id: User.order(Arel.sql("RANDOM()")).first.id,
  price: rand(1.0..100.0).round(2) # Generate random price between 1.00 and 100.00
)
```

**Explanation:**

- `rand(1.0..100.0)`: This generates a random floating-point number between 1.0 and 100.0 (inclusive).
- `round(2)`: This rounds the generated price to two decimal places for a standard currency format.

**Alternative Approaches:**

1. **Faker Gem (for Realistic Data):**

   If you want more realistic-looking random prices, you can use the `Faker` gem:

   ```ruby
   require 'faker'

   article = Article.create!(
     # ... other attributes ...
     price: Faker::Commerce.price(range: 1.0..100.0) # Generates a plausible price
   )
   ```

2. **Custom Price Generation Logic:**

   If you have specific rules for how prices should be generated (e.g., based on article length, category, etc.), create a separate method:

   ```ruby
   def generate_random_price(article)
     # Your custom logic here, e.g.:
     base_price = article.body_markdown.length / 100 
     rand(base_price..(base_price * 3)).round(2)
   end

   article = Article.create!(
     # ... other attributes ...
     price: generate_random_price(article)
   )
   ```

Remember to choose the approach that best fits your needs for random price generation.
